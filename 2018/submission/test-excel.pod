Title: Test/Compare your Excel

=head1 Objectives

Compare 2 Excel files visually.

=head1 Description

It was first published to CPAN on 13th Aug 2010. My first contribution ever and very close to my heart.
It is important to understand the term "visually". It compares the data structure and ignores components
such as embedded fonts, images, forms and annotations.

The package Test::Excel exports the following methods

=over 4

=item cmp_excel_ok($got, $exp, \%$rule, $message)

The params C<$got> and C<$exp> can be path to the two Excel files being compared or it could be an object
of type L<Spreadsheet::ParseExcel>. The param C<\%rule> is optional. Finally the param C<$message> is the
test message, which is optional as well. It is ideal for use in unit test as below.

    use strict; use warnings;
    use Test::More;
    use Test::Excel;

    cmp_excel_ok('foo.xls', 'bar.xls');

    done_testing();

The C<cmp_excel()> is same as C<cmp_excel_ok()>.

=item cmp_execel_not_ok($got, $exp, \%$rule, $message)

Just the reverse of C<cmp_excel_ok()>. It is ideal for use in unit test as below.

    use strict; use warnings;
    use Test::More;
    use Test::Excel;

    cmp_excel_not_ok('foo.xls', 'bar.xls');

    done_testing();

=item compare_excel($got, $exp, \%$rule)

This is the core method that does all the job. It can be used as standalone method outside of test
environment.

     use strict; use warnings;
      use Test::Excel;

       print "EXCELs are identical.\n" if compare_excel("foo.xls", "bar.xls");
